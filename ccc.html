                <p> I promised increasing difficulty, so here it is :)</p>
                
                <p> Fiona commutes to work each day. If there is no rush-hour traffic, her commute time is 2 hours. However, there is often rush-hour traffic. Specifically, rush-hour traffic occurs from 07:00 (7am) until 10:00 (10am) in the morning and 15:00 (3pm) until 19:00 (7pm) in the afternoon. During rush-hour traffic, her speed is reduced by half.

                    She leaves either on the hour (at XX:00), 20 minutes past the hour (at XX:20), or 40 minutes past the hour (at XX:40).
                    
                    Given Fiona's departure time, at what time does she arrive at work?</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p> The input will be one line, which contains an expression of the form HH:MM, in which HH is one of the 24 starting hours (00, 01, ..., 23) and MM is one of the three possible departure minute times (00, 20, 40).</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>Output the time of Fiona's arrival, in the form HH:MM.</p>

                <p>Fiona drives for 3 hours in rush-hour traffic, but only travels as far as she normally would after driving for 1.5 hours. During the final 30 minutes (0.5 hours) she is driving in non-rush-hour traffic. Looks like she's gonna need a late slip!

                <p> Good luck :)</p>
                <p>You want to determine the chances that your favourite team will be the champion of a small tournament.

                    There are exactly four teams. At the end of the tournament, a total of six games will have been played with each team playing every other team exactly once. For each game, either one team wins (and the other loses), or the game ends in a tie. If the game does not end in a tie, the winning team is awarded three points and the losing team is awarded zero points. If the game ends in a tie, each team is awarded one point.
                    
                </p><p>Your favourite team will only be the champion if it ends the tournament with strictly more total points than every other team (i.e., a tie for first place is not good enough for your favourite team).
                    
                    The tournament is not over yet but you know the scores of every game that has already been played. 
                </p><p>You want to consider all possible ways points could be awarded in the remaining games that have not yet been played and determine in how many of these cases your favourite team will be the tournament champion.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line of input will contain an integer 𝑇 which is your favourite team (1 ≤ 𝑇 ≤ 4). The second line will contain an integer 𝐺, the number of games already played (0 ≤ 𝐺 ≤ 5).</p>
                <p> The next 𝐺 lines will give the results of games that have already been played. Each of these lines will consist of four integers 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝑆<sub>𝐴</sub>, 𝑆<sub>𝐵</sub> separated by single spaces where 1 ≤ 𝐴 &lt; 𝐵 ≤ 4, and 𝑆<sub>𝐴</sub>, 𝑆<sub>𝐵</sub> ≥ 0. This corresponds to a game between team 𝐴 (which had score 𝑆<sub>𝐴</sub>) and team 𝐵 (which had score 𝑆<sub>𝐵</sub>) where team 𝐴 won if 𝑆<sub>𝐴</sub> &gt; 𝑆<sub>𝐵</sub>, team 𝐵 won if 𝑆<sub>𝐴</sub> &lt; 𝑆<sub>𝐵</sub> and the game ended in a tie if 𝑆<sub>𝐴</sub> = 𝑆<sub>𝐵</sub>. The pairs 𝐴 and 𝐵 on the input lines are distinct, since no pair of teams plays twice.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will consist of a single integer which is the number of times that team 𝑇 is the champion over all possible awarding of points in the remaining games in the tournament.</p>

                <p>Team 3 has lost two of its three games, and team 4 has tied one and won one, which gives 4 points to team 4. Even if team 3 wins its final game, it cannot have more points than team 4, and thus, will not be champion.</p>

                <p><u>Explanation of Sample Output 2</u></p>
                <p>After the following, we know Team 1 has 1 point, Team 2 has 2 points, Team 3 has 6 points and Team 4 has 1 point.</p>
                <p>There are two remaining games (team 3 plays team 2; team 1 plays team 4). Teams 1, 2 or 4 cannot achieve 6 points, since even if they win their final games, their final point totals will be 4, 5 and 4 respectively. Thus, out of the 9 possible outcomes (2 matches with 3 different possible results per match), team 3 will be the champion in all 9 outcomes.                </p>

                    Each chore takes a certain amount of time, but you may not have enough time to do all of your chores, since you can only complete one chore at a time. You can do the chores in any order that you wish.
                    
                    What is the largest amount of chores you can complete in the given amount of time?</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p> The first line of input consists of an integer 𝑇 (0 ≤ 𝑇 ≤ 100000), which is the total number of minutes you have available to complete your chores.</p>
                <p> The second line of input consists of an integer 𝐶 (0 ≤ 𝐶 ≤ 100), which is the total number of chores that you may choose from. The next 𝐶 lines contain the (positive integer) number of minutes required to do each of these chores. You can assume that each chore will take at most 100000 minutes.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be the maximum number of chores that can be completed in time 𝑇.</p>

                <p> You have a few minutes before your class starts, and you decide to compare the heights of your classmates. You don't have an accurate measuring device, so you just compare relative heights between two people: you stand two people back-to-back, and determine which one of the two is taller. Conveniently, none of your classmates are the same height, and you always compare correctly (i.e., you never make a mistake in your comparisons).

                    After you have done all of your comparisons, you would like to determine who the tallest person is between two particular classmates.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line contains two integers 𝑁 and 𝑀 separated by one space. 𝑁, the number of people in the class, is an integer with 1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 1000000. 𝑀, the number of comparisons that have already been done, is an integer with 1 ≤ 𝑀 ≤ 10000000. Each of the next 𝑀 lines contains two distinct integers 𝑥 and 𝑦 (1 ≤ 𝑥, 𝑦 ≤ 𝑁) separated by a space, indicating that person number 𝑥 was determined to be taller than person number 𝑦. Finally, the last line contains two distinct integers 𝑝 and 𝑞 (1 ≤ 𝑝, 𝑞 ≤ 𝑁) separated by one space: your goal is to determine, if possible, whether person 𝑝 is taller than person 𝑞. Note that it may be the case that neither 𝑝 nor 𝑞 occur in the input concerning measurements between classmates, and each measurement between any two particular people will be recorded exactly once.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output is one line, containing one of three possible strings: yes (if 𝑝 is taller than 𝑞), no (if 𝑞 is taller than 𝑝), unknown (if there is not enough information to determine the relative heights of 𝑝 and 𝑞).</p>

                <p>The input tells us that 3 is taller than 8, 8 is taller than 4, and 4 is taller than 2. Therefore, 3 is taller than 2.</p>

                <p> Consider the measurements as a directed graph, and for each measurement, an edge points from the taller student to the shorter student. We can run BFS or DFS on the graph, and if there exists a path from one student to another, than the first student is taller than the second. Then, we run BFS or DFS again but reversed to find if the first student is shorter. If none of these two cases result, then there's not enough information. </p>

                <p> This week, we look at graph theory, particularly the Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm. </p>
                <p> There is a genre of fiction called choose your own adventure books. These books allow the reader to make choices for the characters which alters the outcome of the story.

                    For example, after reading the first page of a book, the reader may be asked a choice, such as "Do you pick up the rock?" If the reader answers "yes", they are directed to continue reading on page 47, and if they choose "no", they are directed to continue reading on page 18. On each of those pages, they have further choices, and so on, throughout the book. Some pages do not have any choices, and thus these are the "ending" pages of that version of the story. There may be many such ending pages in the book, some of which are good (e.g., the hero finds treasure) and others which are not (e.g., the hero finds a leftover sandwich from 2001).</p>
                <p> You are the editor of one of these books, and you must examine two features of the choose your own adventure book:</p>
                <p> 1. Ensure that every page can be reached – otherwise, there is no reason to pay to print a page which no one can ever read;<br>
                    2. Find the shortest path, so that readers will know what the shortest amount of time they need to finish one version of the story.</p>
                <p>Given a description of the book, examine these two features.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line of input contains 𝑁 (1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 10000), the number of pages in the book. Each of the next 𝑁 lines contain an integer 𝑀𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑁; 0 ≤ 𝑀𝑖 ≤ 𝑁), which is the number of different options from page 𝑖, followed by 𝑀𝑖 space-separated integers in the range from 1 to 𝑁, corresponding to each of the pages to go to next from page 𝑖. It will also be the case 𝑀<sub>1</sub> + 𝑀<sub>2</sub> + ⋯ + 𝑀<sub>N</sub> is at most 10000.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be two lines. The first line will contain Y if all pages are reachable, and N otherwise.

                    The last line will contain a non-negative integer 𝐾, which is the shortest path a reader can take while reading this book. There will always be a finite shortest path.</p>

                <p>In the country of Voronoi, there are N villages, located at distinct points on a straight road. Each of these villages will be represented by an integer position along this road.

                    Each village defines its neighbourhood as all points along the road which are closer to it than to any other village. A point which is equally close to two distinct villages A and B is in the neighbourhood of A and also in the neighbourhood of B.
                    
                    Each neighbourhood has a size which is the difference between the minimum (leftmost) point in its neighbourhood and the maximum (rightmost) point in its neighbourhood.
                    
                    The neighbourhoods of the leftmost and rightmost villages are defined to be of infinite size, while all other neighbourhoods are finite in size.
                    
                    Determine the smallest size of any of the neighbourhoods (with exactly 1 digit after the decimal point).</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line will contain the number N (3≤N≤100), the number of villages. On the next N lines there will be one integer per line, where the ith line contains the integer V<sub>i</sub> , the position of the i<sup>th</sup> village (−1000000000≤V<sub>i</sub>≤1000000000). All villages are at distinct positions.</p>

                <p>A vote is held after singer A and singer B compete in the final round of a singing competition. Your job is to count the votes and determine the outcome.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p> The input will be two lines. The first line will contain V (1 ≤ V ≤ 15), the total number of votes. The second line of input will be a sequence of V characters, each of which will be A or B, representing the votes for a particular singer.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be one of three possibilities: A, if there are more A votes than B votes, B if there are more B votes than A votes, and Tie if there is an equal number of A and B votes.</p>

                <p>You are hosting a party and do not have room to invite all of your friends. You use the following unemotional mathematical method to determine which friends to invite.</p>
                <p>Number your friends 1,2,…,K and place them in a list in this order. Then perform m rounds. In each round, use a number to determine which friends to remove from the ordered list.</p>
                <p>The rounds will use numbers r<sub>1</sub>,r<sub>2</sub>,…,r<sub>m</sub>. In round i, remove all the remaining people in positions that are multiples of r<sub>i</sub> (that is, r<sub>i</sub>,2r<sub>i</sub>,3r<sub>i</sub>,…) The beginning of the list is position 1.</p>
                <p>Please output the numbers of the friends that remain after this removal process.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line of input contains the integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100). The second line of input contains the integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10), which is the number of rounds of removal. The next m lines each contain one integer. The i<sup>th</sup> of these lines (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains r<sub>i</sub> (2 ≤ ri ≤ 100) indicating that every person at a position which is multiple of r<sub>i</sub> should be removed.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be the list of people still invited, one person per line, in increasing order. </p>

                <p>Initially, our list of invitees is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. There will be two rounds of removals. After the first round of removals, we remove the even positions (i.e., every second position), which causes our list of invitees to be {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. After the second round of removals, we remove every 3rd remaining invitee: thus, we keep 1 and 3, remove 5 and keep 7 and 9, which leaves us with an invitee list of {1, 3, 7, 9}.</p>
