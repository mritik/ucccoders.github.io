                    Each village defines its neighbourhood as all points along the road which are closer to it than to any other village. A point which is equally close to two distinct villages A and B is in the neighbourhood of A and also in the neighbourhood of B.
                    
                    Each neighbourhood has a size which is the difference between the minimum (leftmost) point in its neighbourhood and the maximum (rightmost) point in its neighbourhood.
                    
                    The neighbourhoods of the leftmost and rightmost villages are defined to be of infinite size, while all other neighbourhoods are finite in size.

                <p>You are hosting a party and do not have room to invite all of your friends. You use the following unemotional mathematical method to determine which friends to invite.</p>
                <p>Number your friends 1,2,…,K and place them in a list in this order. Then perform m rounds. In each round, use a number to determine which friends to remove from the ordered list.</p>

                <p>Please output the numbers of the friends that remain after this removal process.</p>

                <p>The first line of input contains the integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100). The second line of input contains the integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10), which is the number of rounds of removal.

After the first round of removals, we remove the even positions (i.e., every second position), which causes our list of invitees to be {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. After the second round of removals, we remove every 3rd remaining invitee: thus, we keep 1 and 3, remove 5 and keep 7 and 9, which leaves us with an invitee list of {1, 3, 7, 9}.</p>
