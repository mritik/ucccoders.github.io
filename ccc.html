                The UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy will help organize the CCC and provide resources and weekly problems on this page to help members prepare for it. The Canadian Computing Competition, or CCC, will be held on February 12, 2020. Organized by the University of Waterloo, this is the primary coding contest in Canada. The contest consists of a Junior and Senior level that you can choose from - both are open to all upper school students.
