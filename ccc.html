                The UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy will help organize the CCC and provide resources and weekly problems on this page to help members prepare for it. The Canadian Computing Competition, or CCC, will be held on February 12, 2020. Organized by the University of Waterloo, this is the primary coding contest in Canada. The contest consists of a Junior and Senior level that you can choose from - both are open to all upper school students.

            <p> If you wish to write the CCC this year, please fill out this <a target="_blank"href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WvnOWGzzhL_vk8m7F9LNgQ6WmhuwuFKSt3g3ZYJKWN0/">Google Form</a> first. </p>

            <p> The <a target="_blank"href = "https://cccgrader.com/index.php"> CCC Online Grader</a> is used to participate in the actual competition and to work on past CCC problems for practice. The grader allows you to upload your code for automatic scoring. </p>
            <p> If you have made an account in previous years, you should be good to go. If you have forgotten your login info, check your email as you may have received your username/password via email when you registered. If not, please contact Mr. Miskew at pmiskew@ucc.on.ca.  </p>
            <p> If you don't have an account for the online grader yet, register <a target="_blank"href = "https://cccgrader.com/register.php">here</a> using your legal name. Please also contact kevin.liu@ucc.on.ca for the school number. After registering you will wait for Mr. Miskew's approval, which will grant you full access to the system. </p>

            <h4 class = "pb-3"> Prep Resources</h4>

            <p>For any new contest takers, you should familiarize yourself with the contest <a target = "_blank" href = "https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/details.html">info</a> and <a target = "_blank" href = "https://cccgrader.com/rules.pdf">rules</a>, as well as <a href = "https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/examples.html" target = "_blank">an example problem to learn inputs/outputs</a>. </p>

            <p> Once logged in to the official CCC online grader, you will have access to some past contest questions on which your answers can be graded as per the official CCC rules.</p>
            <p><a href = "https://dmoj.ca/problems/" target = "_blank">DMOJ</a> is a website with a large database of questions from coding contests including the CCC. It interestingly has more CCC problems available than on the official grader and answers/editorials to some problems (to find CCC problems, just search CCC in the problem search box). Please note that while DMOJ will also grade your answers once you make an account, the format is slightly different compared to the official CCC grader so make sure you're familiar with the official one before the contest. </p>

                <p>A vote is held after singer A and singer B compete in the final round of a singing competition. Your job is to count the votes and determine the outcome.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p> The input will be two lines. The first line will contain V (1 ≤ V ≤ 15), the total number of votes. The second line of input will be a sequence of V characters, each of which will be A or B, representing the votes for a particular singer.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be one of three possibilities: A, if there are more A votes than B votes, B if there are more B votes than A votes, and Tie if there is an equal number of A and B votes.</p>

                <p>You are hosting a party and do not have room to invite all of your friends. You use the following unemotional mathematical method to determine which friends to invite.</p>
                <p>Number your friends 1,2,…,K and place them in a list in this order. Then perform m rounds. In each round, use a number to determine which friends to remove from the ordered list.</p>
                <p>The rounds will use numbers r<sub>1</sub>,r<sub>2</sub>,…,r<sub>m</sub>. In round i, remove all the remaining people in positions that are multiples of r<sub>i</sub> (that is, r<sub>i</sub>,2r<sub>i</sub>,3r<sub>i</sub>,…) The beginning of the list is position 1.</p>
                <p>Please output the numbers of the friends that remain after this removal process.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line of input contains the integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100). The second line of input contains the integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10), which is the number of rounds of removal. The next m lines each contain one integer. The i<sup>th</sup> of these lines (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains r<sub>i</sub> (2 ≤ ri ≤ 100) indicating that every person at a position which is multiple of r<sub>i</sub> should be removed.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be one of three possibilities: A, if there are more A votes than B votes, B if there are more B votes than A votes, and Tie if there is an equal number of A and B votes.</p>

                <p><u>Explanation of Sample Output</u></p>
                <p>Initially, our list of invitees is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. There will be two rounds of removals. After the first round of removals, we remove the even positions (i.e., every second position), which causes our list of invitees to be {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. After the second round of removals, we remove every 3rd remaining invitee: thus, we keep 1 and 3, remove 5 and keep 7 and 9, which leaves us with an invitee list of {1, 3, 7, 9}.</p>
