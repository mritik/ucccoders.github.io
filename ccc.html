                <p> You have been asked by a parental unit to do your chores.

                    Each chore takes a certain amount of time, but you may not have enough time to do all of your chores, since you can only complete one chore at a time. You can do the chores in any order that you wish.
                    
                    What is the largest amount of chores you can complete in the given amount of time?</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p> The first line of input consists of an integer 𝑇 (0 ≤ 𝑇 ≤ 100000), which is the total number of minutes you have available to complete your chores.</p>
                <p> The second line of input consists of an integer 𝐶 (0 ≤ 𝐶 ≤ 100), which is the total number of chores that you may choose from. The next 𝐶 lines contain the (positive integer) number of minutes required to do each of these chores. You can assume that each chore will take at most 100000 minutes.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be the maximum number of chores that can be completed in time 𝑇.</p>

            <h4> Week 4 - Senior</h4>
            <h5 class="lead">Jan 24, 2020</h5>

                <p> You have a few minutes before your class starts, and you decide to compare the heights of your classmates. You don't have an accurate measuring device, so you just compare relative heights between two people: you stand two people back-to-back, and determine which one of the two is taller. Conveniently, none of your classmates are the same height, and you always compare correctly (i.e., you never make a mistake in your comparisons).

                    After you have done all of your comparisons, you would like to determine who the tallest person is between two particular classmates.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line contains two integers 𝑁 and 𝑀 separated by one space. 𝑁, the number of people in the class, is an integer with 1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 1000000. 𝑀, the number of comparisons that have already been done, is an integer with 1 ≤ 𝑀 ≤ 10000000. Each of the next 𝑀 lines contains two distinct integers 𝑥 and 𝑦 (1 ≤ 𝑥, 𝑦 ≤ 𝑁) separated by a space, indicating that person number 𝑥 was determined to be taller than person number 𝑦. Finally, the last line contains two distinct integers 𝑝 and 𝑞 (1 ≤ 𝑝, 𝑞 ≤ 𝑁) separated by one space: your goal is to determine, if possible, whether person 𝑝 is taller than person 𝑞. Note that it may be the case that neither 𝑝 nor 𝑞 occur in the input concerning measurements between classmates, and each measurement between any two particular people will be recorded exactly once.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output is one line, containing one of three possible strings: yes (if 𝑝 is taller than 𝑞), no (if 𝑞 is taller than 𝑝), unknown (if there is not enough information to determine the relative heights of 𝑝 and 𝑞).</p>
                <p><u>Sample Input</u></p>
                <pre>
10 3

                <p class = "code">yes<br> </p><br>
                <p><u>Explanation of Sample Output</u></p>
                <p>The input tells us that 3 is taller than 8, 8 is taller than 4, and 4 is taller than 2. Therefore, 3 is taller than 2.</p>

                <p> This week, we look at graph theory, particularly the Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm. </p>
                <p> There is a genre of fiction called choose your own adventure books. These books allow the reader to make choices for the characters which alters the outcome of the story.

                    For example, after reading the first page of a book, the reader may be asked a choice, such as "Do you pick up the rock?" If the reader answers "yes", they are directed to continue reading on page 47, and if they choose "no", they are directed to continue reading on page 18. On each of those pages, they have further choices, and so on, throughout the book. Some pages do not have any choices, and thus these are the "ending" pages of that version of the story. There may be many such ending pages in the book, some of which are good (e.g., the hero finds treasure) and others which are not (e.g., the hero finds a leftover sandwich from 2001).</p>
                <p> You are the editor of one of these books, and you must examine two features of the choose your own adventure book:</p>
                <p> 1. Ensure that every page can be reached – otherwise, there is no reason to pay to print a page which no one can ever read;<br>
                    2. Find the shortest path, so that readers will know what the shortest amount of time they need to finish one version of the story.</p>
                <p>Given a description of the book, examine these two features.</p>
                <p><u>Input Specification</u></p>
                <p>The first line of input contains 𝑁 (1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 10000), the number of pages in the book. Each of the next 𝑁 lines contain an integer 𝑀𝑖 (1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑁; 0 ≤ 𝑀𝑖 ≤ 𝑁), which is the number of different options from page 𝑖, followed by 𝑀𝑖 space-separated integers in the range from 1 to 𝑁, corresponding to each of the pages to go to next from page 𝑖. It will also be the case 𝑀<sub>1</sub> + 𝑀<sub>2</sub> + ⋯ + 𝑀<sub>N</sub> is at most 10000.</p>
                <p><u>Output Specification</u></p>
                <p>The output will be two lines. The first line will contain Y if all pages are reachable, and N otherwise.

                    The last line will contain a non-negative integer 𝐾, which is the shortest path a reader can take while reading this book. There will always be a finite shortest path.</p>

                <p>Every page is reachable, since from page 1, we can reach pages 2 and 3. The shortest path is the path 1→2, which contains two pages.</p>

                <p>In the country of Voronoi, there are N villages, located at distinct points on a straight road. Each of these villages will be represented by an integer position along this road.

                    Each village defines its neighbourhood as all points along the road which are closer to it than to any other village. A point which is equally close to two distinct villages A and B is in the neighbourhood of A and also in the neighbourhood of B.
                    
                    Each neighbourhood has a size which is the difference between the minimum (leftmost) point in its neighbourhood and the maximum (rightmost) point in its neighbourhood.
                    
                    The neighbourhoods of the leftmost and rightmost villages are defined to be of infinite size, while all other neighbourhoods are finite in size.

                <p>You are hosting a party and do not have room to invite all of your friends. You use the following unemotional mathematical method to determine which friends to invite.</p>
                <p>Number your friends 1,2,…,K and place them in a list in this order. Then perform m rounds. In each round, use a number to determine which friends to remove from the ordered list.</p>

                <p>Please output the numbers of the friends that remain after this removal process.</p>

                <p>The first line of input contains the integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100). The second line of input contains the integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10), which is the number of rounds of removal.

                <p>Initially, our list of invitees is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. There will be two rounds of removals. After the first round of removals, we remove the even positions (i.e., every second position), which causes our list of invitees to be {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. After the second round of removals, we remove every 3rd remaining invitee: thus, we keep 1 and 3, remove 5 and keep 7 and 9, which leaves us with an invitee list of {1, 3, 7, 9}.</p>
