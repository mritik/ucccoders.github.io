                    <p>Hello guys, I am Nima Bidari, Year 10 from Howards House.</p>
                    <p class="mt-0">During each section discussion, I will explain a new topic, which could be a new algorithm for us to work on or discuss, as well as its applications. We will also talk about things happening currently in the world of Machine Learning, as well as how they would be coded. After a few meetings discussing an algorithm I will show you how they would actually be coded.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">My goal is not to turn you into a machine that can pump out AI as quickly as possible, but rather someone who understands the theory, and has good Machine Learning practices. This will allow you to work more efficiently in the future, create better algorithms, as well as understand which algorithms should be used at certain points.</p>

            <h4> What is Machine Learning?</h4>
            <h5 class="lead">Sept. 26, 2019</h5>
            <p> The idea of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has been toyed with for a long time. Many films on the big screen have been seen using AI and ML, like Terminator, Avengers: Age of Ultron, or all Iron Man films (Jarvis). They rarely go deep into how they came to be, but rather that these computers are suddenly able to think for themselves.</p>
            <p> In 1959, Arthur Samuel gave this description of Machine Learning: The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</p>
            <p> This is in contrast to AI, where the computer is explicitly programmed to behave in a certain way. In Machine Learning, we simply give the computer an algorithm to learn for itself, through trial and error (like real humans). There are many ways that scientists are trying to make robots that can think like humans, however, most often an algorithm that is programmed like a human brain, is able to learn like a human. These are called Neural Networks.</p>
            <p> Let's take a step back, however, becuase many algorithms, used frequently with professional algorithms, are much simpler and more logical and statistical.</p>
            <p> Tom Mitchell, in 1998, defined a Machine Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.</p>
            <p> Heres an example. Have you ever noticed that you get spam much less frequently than before? A spam filter is an ML algorithm that filters out spam emails, based on what emails that are marked spam frequently look like. In this scenario, the task T is marking spam emails, the performance measure P is whether or not emails that aren't marked by the algorithm are then marked by the user (probability of email being spam), and experience E is the input of seeing a bunch of emails marked spam by the user, and then developing an algorithm to allow the computer to mark those emails spam by itself.</p>
            <p> Just to clarify, the computer makes these algorithms itself, we simply tell it how to learn. You can think of your job, as a Machine Learning Engineer, to teach the computer how to learn, and it will learn by itself.</p>
