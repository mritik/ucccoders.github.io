                        <p>Welcome to the Project Development section of the UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy. We are William Trojniak and Oliver Tattersall, Grade 11 students at UCC.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Every two months or so, we will be presenting a general theme around which club members will design a game, website or similar project individually, focusing on a certain skill each meeting. These skills could include techniques such as database management, game design, and etc. By the end of the two months, the goal for the club members is that by incorporating these elements into their own projects, they have created something fully functional with their own creative takes on the original theme.  </p>
