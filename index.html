				<h1 class="display-4">Meeting Format</h1>
				<h4> The club will meet every Thursday for 90 minutes after school at the Design Lab. Each meeting will be split into two parts.</h4>
			
				<button class="accordion"><h4> 	&#9660; Section Discussions</h4></button>
				<div class="panel">
				<p>In this part, the Club will group together in the Design Lab, where section heads take turns leading discussions about topics in their respective sections (algorithmic study, game design, web development, and AI study). The length of each discussion will depend on the attendance, interest, and preparation of the section head, but will usually be around 15-25 minutes for each section. The Club should touch basis on all four of the sections within a two-week time span, and thus should cover at least two sections each week. The Group Section Discussion will last about 40-50 minutes.</p>
				</div>
				

				<button class="accordion"><h4> 	&#9660; Ongoing Projects</h4></button>
				<div class="panel">
				<p>In this part, different sections of the Club will work on one or two projects for about 30-45 minutes. On our Club website, there will be a form on which the UCC community can post project requests. At the start, Mr. Miskew will have a few projects that he is looking for and we can choose from. As these projects are fairly big projects, the Club will farm out parts and each section head will lead his section to work on one relevant part. And then each section head will report to the Club their progress and share their approach during the next meetingâ€™s Group Section Discussion.</p>

									<h5> Run by Kevin Liu</h5>
									<hr class = "my-4">
									<p class="card-text">During each Section Discussion led by Kevin, Kevin will bring up a well-defined algorithmic topic and lead a discussion about it. Then he will give a typical problem of the topic for members to think about for the next session. In the next Section Discussion led by Kevin, he will allow members to share their solutions and thoughts for the problem and discuss each of their solutions, and then the group will move onto another well-defined topic. On the Club website under the Section of Algorithmic Study, Kevin will post the current algorithmic topic and the "question of the week"; and after a topic is done, he will post a brief summary note and then archive the topic.</p>

							<h5> Run by Nima Bidari</h5>
							<hr class = "my-4">
							<p class="card-text">Each Section Discussion meeting is split into two parts: a theoretical exploration and a practical exploration of machine learning. First, Nima will lead a discussion about AI current events. Then Nima will explore a more advanced topic in a more in-depth discussion, while not going to deep about how to code it. The second half will focus on solving a new problem in the AI area, which the Club members will collaborate to solve for the couple of next weeks. The language to be used is either Python (Scikit Learn & Tensorflow) or Javascript (Tensorflow.js). Members will share and discuss their solutions the next Section Discussion before diving into the next topic. </p>

									<hr class = "my-4">
									<p class="card-text">During each Section Discussion, Ibrahim will find an interesting topic related to web development to discuss. He will look at real world problems and how to attack them. A heavy focus will be put on writing clean reusable code that anyone could look at and understand. Members will be given the opportunity to try to solve these problems, then talk about these solutions and discuss the benefits of each. In some meetings Ibrahim will look at certain libraries such as Bootstrap and how to use them, as these are very useful tools in the real world. He might also look at front-end frameworks such as React near the end of the year.  </p>

									<h5> Run by William Trojniak</h5>
									<hr class = "my-4">
									<p class="card-text">Every two months or so, William will be presenting a general theme that club members will design a game around. Then, he will gradually build his own game around this theme, focusing on a certain element of the game each meeting. For example, this could include features such as character movement, health, or a score indicator. By the end of the two months, the goal for the club members is that by incorporating these elements into their own games, they have created something that is fully playable. Club members will then be given a chance to show off their own creative takes on the original theme as well as any extra features that they've implemented.   </p>
