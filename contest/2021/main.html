            <p> It's time for the 2021 UCC Coding Competition! <a href = "/contest/2020/main.html">Last year's contest</a> was very successful with participants from 11 different schools across Ontario. We hope that this year's contest will continue to allow coders from various backgrounds to compete and hopefully have some fun. </p>
            <p> Please note that this year, the contest will be held on the DMOJ online judge to facilitate participation and scoring, so please review the instructions on this page carefully. <b><u>Participants will need to register prior to the contest.</u></b></p>
            <h5>The UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy will host the second annual UCC Coding Competition on April 23-26, 2021. </h5> <br>

            <h4>Details</h4>
            <div id = "inst" >
                <br>
                <p> This is a 2-hour, 5-problem competition similar to the CCC. Contestants will be able to log in and start a personal 2-hour time window between Friday, April 23, 2021 and Monday, April 26, 2021. </p>
                <p> Each problem is worth 10 marks, with approximate level of difficulty ranging from CCC Junior 2 to CCC Senior 4. </p>
                <p> There is no limit to how many solutions you can submit to the grader. The grader will score your submission and show you how many points you were awarded. If you submitted multiple solutions to a problem, the highest scoring submission will be counted. This is a similar process to the CCC. However, please note that ties will be broken by the time of the last submission that increased a participant's score.</p>
                <p> The contest is open to all high school students in participating schools. </p>
            </div><br>
            <h4> Before The Contest</h4><br>
            <div>
                <p><b>1. If you do not have a DMOJ account already, go to <a href="http://www.dmoj.ca" target="_blank">dmoj.ca</a> and create one.</b> DMOJ is the online grading platform that will be used for the contest (it is similar to the CCC grader). Note that the leaderboard of the competition will publically display the DMOJ usernames and scores of all participants, so choose a username accordingly.</p>
                <p><b>2. Go to <a href = "https://dmoj.ca/organization/172-ucc-coding-competition-2021" target = "_blank">this link</a> and follow the instructions on that page after logging in to your DMOJ account. </b>In particular, you will need to request membership and fill in your first name, last name, grade, school name, and email address using the format detailed on that page. </p>
                <p><b>3. If you are unfamiliar with the DMOJ platform</b>, you should try solving a <a href = "https://dmoj.ca/problem/helloworld" target="_blank">"Hello, World!"</a> problem and/or <a target="_blank" href = "https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=ucc+coding+competition">last year's UCC Coding Competition problems</a>, and submitting your code for grading. The DMOJ grader will automatically test your code and give you a score. Please also familiarize yourself with DMOJ status codes (e.g. WA for Wrong Answer, TLE for Time Limit Exceeded)  <a href = "https://dmoj.ca/about/codes/" target = "_blank">here</a>, so you know what the grader's fedeback means. </p>
            </div><br>
            <h4> During The Contest</h4><br>
            <div>
                <p><b>1. On April 23-26, log in to DMOJ and go to the contest page.</b> If you go to <a href = "https://dmoj.ca/contests" target = "_blank">this page</a>, you should see the UCC Coding Competition as a contest you can join. </p>
                <p><b>2. Start the contest.</b> This will start a personal 2-hour window, so make sure you have 2 continuous hours to do the contest.  </p>
                <p><b>3. Find and solve the problems.</b> Once you start the contest, you should be redirected to a page showing all five problems. As long as your 2-hour window hasn't expired, the "Problems" tab on the navigation bar will always take you back to this page. <br><br>Once you click into one of the five problems and have coded a solution, use the "Submit Solution" button and paste your code for the grader to grade. The grader will tell you how many points you obtained. If you did not obtain full marks, you are encouraged to adjust your code and try submitting again, or to work on another problem. If the grader gives you a status code such as WA or TLE, you can find out what it means <a href = "https://dmoj.ca/about/codes/" target = "_blank">here</a>. Please see the Details section above for more information about scoring. </p>

                <p>Internet use is allowed to look up language and syntax on programming languages' official documentation only. Searching on sites like StackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, or YouTube is not permitted.</p>
                <p>Do not consult or use any previously written program by yourself or others. <b>Note that there are anti-plagiarism systems built in to the contest hosting platform.</b> </p>

            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <div id = "tips">
                <br>
                <p>- To prepare, take a look at <a target="_blank" href = "https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=ucc+coding+competition">last year's problems</a>, and try coding them! </p>
                <p>- Read each problem! While the problems are generally in order of difficulty this might not necessarily be the case. </p>
                <p>- Take advantage of part marks! Subtasks worth partial marks will be detailed in the problem statements and the point value for each test case is clearly indicated. In many cases, focusing on getting partial marks (especially for the later problems) can be much easier than tackling the full problem. </p>
                <p>- For clarifications about the rules or problem statements, contact kevin.liu@ucc.on.ca.</p>
