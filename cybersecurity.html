                        <p>Welcome to the Cybersecurity section of the UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy. I am Jefferson Ding, a Grade 10 student at UCC.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Over the school year, I will be presenting a variety of cybersecurity challenges and issues. These challenges cover network attack and defences, radio hacking, CTF challenges and real-life issues. These questions require knowledge ranging from maths to overclocking the CPU, so you will most likely learn something new. CTF competitions are information security-focused challenges that various organizations host; our goal is to form a team of 5-10 players and compete against other teams.  </p>
