                        <p>Welcome to the Cybersecurity section of the UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy. I am Jefferson Ding, a Grade 11 student at UCC.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Over the school year, I will be presenting a variety of cybersecurity challenges and issues. These challenges cover network attack and defences, radio hacking, CTF challenges and real-life issues. These questions require knowledge ranging from maths to overclocking the CPU, so you will most likely learn something new. CTF competitions are information security-focused challenges that various organizations host; our goal is to form a team of 5-10 players and compete against other teams.  </p>

            <p>This year, our club sent two teams and one individual participant for the picoCTF CanHack, which is the largest cybersecurity hacking competition for middle and high school students. Our top performing team, led by Jefferson, placed <b>5th overall in Canada and 17th worldwide</b>. This result is extraordinary - congratulations to all participants!</p>
            <p>Jefferson has written writeups of his solutions to many of this year's picoCTF problems. You can find them <a href = "https://github.com/JeffersonDing/CTF/tree/master/pico_CTF_2021" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
