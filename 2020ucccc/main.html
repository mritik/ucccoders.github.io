            <hr class="my-4">
              
            <h4>Details</h4>
            <div id = "inst" >
                <br>
                <p> This is a 2 hour, 6 problem competition that will run from 1:00PM to 3:00PM on Apr [DATE IS STILL TBD], 2020 (Eastern Daylight Time). Due to current conditions the contest will be hosted online through this webpage this year. </p>
                <p> Each problem is worth 10 marks, with approximate level of difficulty ranging from CCC Junior 2 to CCC Senior 3. Ties will be broken by time of submission of the final answer form. </p>
                <p> The contest is open to all students in the UCC Upper School. The champion will be named "UCC Coder of the Year" and announced to the school! </p>

            <h4> Instructions</h4><br>
            <div>
                <p> At 1:00PM on the day of the competition, a link to the problem set and test data will be posted below.</p>
                <p> The job is to solve the problems (using any method and coding language). Each problem will have multiple test cases following the input specification detailed within each problem. These test cases will be posted below and can be copied to clipboard using the provided button.  </p>
                <p> The correct answer for each test case is an integer between 0 and 1000. You should run each test case through your program and produce the correct answer.  </p>
                <p> There are also non-scored test cases similar to the scored ones with correct answers provided so you can test your program. </p>
                <p> Write down your answers to each test case - they must be submitted together through the Google Form linked below before 3:00 PM. Once you submit this form, your contest is over and you will not be allowed to make changes. If your form isn't submitted by 3:01 PM, your result will not be counted. </p>

            <h4> Rules</h4>
            <div id = "rule">
                <br>
                <p>Do not communicate with other contestants or individuals before you have submitted your contest. This includes communication online or through social media. </p>
                <p>Do not discuss these problems online until after the contest window ends at 3:00PM on the date of the contest.</p>
                <p>Internet use is allowed to lookup language and syntax on programming languages' official documentation only. Searching on sites like StackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, or YouTube is not permitted.</p>
                <p>You may use calculators, erasers, pencils, rulers, compasses, protractors, scratch paper, and other similar aids. </p>
                <p>Do not consult or use any previously written program by yourself or others. </p>
                <p>Attempts to circumvent the contest system is strictly prohibited.</p>
                <p style = "color: red"> IMPROPER CONDUCT OR VIOLATION OF RULES WILL RESULT IN SCORE OF 0, PERMANENT BAN AND NOTIFICATION OF ACADEMIC ADVISOR!</p>
            </div><br>
            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <div id = "tips">
                <br>
                <p>Always read each problem! While the problems are generally in order of difficulty this might not necessarily be the case! </p>
                <p>A test case worth 1/10 for every problem can be solved without the need for coding - comprehension of the problem is enough. </p>
                <p>Take advantage of part marks! Partial subtasks will be detailed in the problem statements and the point value for each test case is made clear.</p>
                <p>Make sure you use the provided example test cases to test your program! </p>
                <p>Write down your answers somewhere other than the Google Form as well. If you accidentally close the Google Form your answers will not be saved.</p>
                <p>Save yourself some time to fill out and complete the Google Form. Form responses later than 3:01PM will not be accepted. </p>
