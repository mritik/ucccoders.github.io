                        <p>Welcome to the STEM Fellowship section of the UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy. We are Joshua Li and Leo Zhang, Grade 11 students at UCC.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">The STEM Fellowship Data Science section of the Coding & Algorithms Academy focuses on the growing field of data science and big data analytics. In particular, we prepare for the High School Big Data Challenge hosted by SF, which prompts students to conduct analysis on public data sets and present their findings in academic papers. Our section also offers a means to engage in webinars, workshops and other opportunities offered by SF in the field of data science. </p>
