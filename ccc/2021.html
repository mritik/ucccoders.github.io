                <h2 class = "pb-3"> Registration and Instructions</h2>
                <p> <b>Our club hosted an information session about the CCC - the recording of the meeting is available <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_P4bz53lq1raWTtEenDwE8fujMFF-mko/view?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here.</a></b>  </p>

                <p> If you wish to write the CCC this year, please fill out this <a target="_blank"href = "https://forms.gle/i7vxsQto97Yjd7wQ9">Google Form</a> first. </p>

                <p> The <a target="_blank"href = "https://cccgrader.com/index.php"> CCC Online Grader</a> is used to participate in the actual competition and to work on past CCC problems for practice. The grader allows you to upload your code for automatic scoring. </p>
                <p> If you have made an account in previous years, you should be good to go (but make sure that you still remember your login). If you have forgotten your login info, check your email as you may have received your username/password via email when you registered. If not, please contact Mr. Miskew at pmiskew@ucc.on.ca.  </p>
                <p> If you don't have an account for the online grader yet, please contact Kevin Liu first at kevin.liu@ucc.on.ca for the school number, and then register <a target="_blank"href = "https://cccgrader.com/register.php">here</a> using your legal name. After registering you will wait for Mr. Miskew's approval, which will grant you full access to the system. </p>
                
                <p>For any new contest takers, you should familiarize yourself with the contest <a target = "_blank" href = "https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/details.html">info</a> and <a target = "_blank" href = "https://cccgrader.com/rules.pdf">rules</a>, as well as <a href = "https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/examples.html" target = "_blank">an example problem to learn inputs/outputs</a>. </p>

                <p> Once logged in to the official CCC online grader, you will have access to some past contest questions on which your answers can be graded as per the official CCC rules. Prior to the contest, there will also be a mock contest on the online grader. It is highly recommended to familiarize yourself with the grader system by doing a few practice questions prior to the contest. </p>
