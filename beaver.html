                <p>The UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy is pleased to help host the 2020 University of Waterloo Beaver Computing Challenge at UCC. This challenge is a problem-solving contest with a focus on computational and logical thinking. Questions are inspired by topics in computer science but only require comfort with concepts found in a regular mathematics curriculum. </p>
                
                <p>More details can be found <a href = "https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/bcc.html" target = "javascript.void(0);">here</a>, and problems from past contests can be found <a href = "https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#bcc" target = "javascript.void(0);">here</a>.</p>
                
                <p>If you're interested in this contest, please use <a href = "https://forms.gle/w8c6yTAjXbha7qFB9" target = "javascript.void(0);">this Google Form</a> to sign up by <b>Monday, November 2.</b></p>
                
                <p>The contest will be held on one day during the <b>weeks of Nov 9 and 16, 2020</b>. More logistical information will be sent to those who are signed up closer to the date of the contest. We expect that the contest will be held in a virtual format and participants should have some flexibility as to when they want to write the contest.

                    <p>Boxes are shown below. Each box is labeled with its mass in kilograms.</p>

                    <p>Xena the delivery beaver fills out a form to order boxes. For example, to order boxes totaling exactly 9 kilograms, she fills out the form as follows:</p>

                    <p>How many check marks should she put on the form to order boxes totaling exactly 22 kilograms?</p>

                <div class = "problem pb-4" id = "beavers1" >
                    <p>The answer is 3. </p>
                    <p>Order the boxes weighing 2kg, 4kg, and 16kg to reach the required 22kg. </p>

                <h5>Problem 2 - Frog Jump</h5><br>
                <p><a href = "javascript:void(0);" onclick="hideshow('beaverp2')"> Problem (Click to reveal)</a></p>
                <div class = "problem pb-4" id = "beaverp2" >
                    <p>A frog gets exercise by jumping around a pond. It jumps from lily pad to lily pad in the sequence shown in the picture below. It starts at the lily pad labelled S. It ends on the lily pad as shown (i.e., the frog shown has finished jumping). Each black dot marks a lily pad on which the frog has landed.</p>
                    
                    <p>The legend below labels each of the 8 possible directions of a jump with an integer from 0 to 7.</p>
                    <img src = "media/beaver3.png" class = "col col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                    <p>Which sequence describes the frog's path?</p>
                    <p>Answer choices: </p>
                    <p>4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1</p>
                    <p>0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1</p>
                    <p>0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4</p>
                    <p>6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1</p>
                </div>
                <p><a href = "javascript:void(0);" onclick="hideshow('beavers2')"> Answer (Click to reveal)</a></p>
                <div class = "problem pb-4" id = "beavers2" >
                    <p>The answer is: 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1</p>
                    <p>We can see that the frog moves towards the right first. Checking the legend, a move towards the right corresponds to a move in the direction 0.</p>
                    <p>Also, the frog ends by moving towards the up and right diagonal. The legend tells us that this is direction 1.</p>
                    <p>The answer 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1 is the only answer choice starting with 0 and ending with 1, so it must be the answer.</p>

                <div class = "problem pb-4" id = "beaverp3" >
                    <p>Lucia and her friends are part of an on-line social network.</p>
                    
                    <p>Below is a diagram describing the relationships among Lucia and her friends. Each line indicates a friendship.</p>
                    <img src = "media/beaver4.png" class = "col col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
                    <p></p><p>Lucia sends a photo to some of her friends.

                        Each of those friends sends the photo to all of their friends.</p>
                    <p>Which of the following groups of friends can Lucia send her photo to so that Jacob is not sent the photo?</p>
                    <p>Answer choices: </p>
                    <p>Dana, Michael, Eve</p>
                    <p>Dana, Eve, Monica</p>
                    <p>Michael, Eve, Jacob</p>
                    <p>Michael, Peter, Monica</p>

                <p><a href = "javascript:void(0);" onclick="hideshow('beavers3')"> Answer (Click to reveal)</a></p>
                <div class = "problem pb-4" id = "beavers3" >
                    <p>The answer is: Dana, Michael, Eve</p>
                    <p>Obviously, we cannot send the photo to Jacob, so the third answer choice is incorrect. Also, Monica is friends with Jacob, so we cannot send the photo to Monica. This rules out the second and fourth answer choices.</p>
                    <p>None of the people in the first answer choice are friends with Jacob. Therefore, the first answer choice is the correct answer. </p>
