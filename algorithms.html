                        <p>Welcome to the Algorithms section of the UCC Coding and Algorithms Academy. We are Kevin Liu and Joshua Li, Grade 11 students at UCC.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">The Algorithms Section is where UCC coders study computer algorithms and their applications in contest problems and in the real-world. Over the year, we will cover content for all skill levels (from if-else statements to data structures and dynamic programming). We will also provide training that helps sharpenen members' skills for many of the competitions we help organize at UCC, such as the CCC, ECOO, Beaver Computing Challenge, and our very own UCC Coding Competition. Please take a look at the resources provided below! </p>
