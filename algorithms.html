                    <p>Welcome to the Algorithmic Study section. I am Kevin Liu, a Grade 10 student in Jackson's House.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">During each section discussion, I will first give a short introduction on a well-defined algorithmic topic. Then I will leave a relevant "problem of the week" for members to work over the next couple of weeks. At the next discussion, I will allow members to share their solutions for the problem before moving onto the next topic. After each topic, I will post summarizing notes of it, as well as the solution of the "Problem of the Week" on this page.  </p>

            <h4> Intro to Recursion - Fibonacci Sequences</h4>
            <h5 class="lead">Sept. 26, 2019</h5>
            <p>The Fibonacci Sequence is the famous sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13..., where the first two terms are 1 and each term after that is the sum of the two terms prior to it. Today we will look at different methods of generating the fibonacci sequence and similar sequences. </p>
            <p>Generating the fibonacci sequence is relatively straightforward if we just start from 1, 1 and work our way up step by step, by the definition of the sequence. However, it is also possible to recursively generate the sequence by defining a function and calling it recursively (see the pseudocode below that finds the k'th fibonacci number.)  </p>
            <p class = "code">def fibonacci(n): </p>
            <p class = "code pl-3">if n == 1 or n == 2: </p>
            <p class = "code pl-5">return 1 </p>
            <p class = "code pl-3">else: </p>
            <p class = "code pl-5">return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) </p>
            <p class = "code">fibonacci(k) </p>
            <p class = "pt-3">In this way, the desired fibonacci number is generated by searching directly for the two numbers before it. But as we don't yet have the two numbers before it (if n > 4), to find each of those two numbers before it, we keep going backwards in the sequence until we reach the exit condition, which is when n = 1 or 2. When we get to that point, we will have found the third fibonacci number, meaning we have found the fourth, fifth, and so on, all the way to n. </p>
            <p>The steps that this recursive algorithm takes can be best viewed as a tree, which will be discussed in the meeting on Thursday, September 26. We will also look at a nice way to speed up this recursion algorithm.  </p>
            <h5> Question of the Week: Fibonacci Sequences</h5>
            <p> The Tribonacci Sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9. The first three terms are defined to be 1, 1, 1 and every term after that is the sum of the three terms before it. Code a program that can find the n'th term in the tribonacci sequence. Try to complete this program using recursion! </p>
